# Positioning Elements Introduction

## The purpose of this repository is to cover the  5 main values of the Position Property: 

## 1. Relative
## 2. Absolute
## 3. Static
## 4. Fixed
## 5. Sticky

### We'll be going through each one in the order listed above, throughout this repo you will find I provided links at the end of the MD. to view the code yourself and mess around with it to better understand each type on your own, I strongly reccommend this as it will give you the best understanding. Now let's get into it.. 


# Position Type: Relative

## The relative type enables you to shift the position of an element in association to it's original position. 

### In this instance let's take a look at the source code below, you can see we have the internal green square set to relative along by setting it 10px to the right. The internal square should move 10px from it's original position to the right (check image example provided below).

```
<style> 
    <h1> testing </h1>
</style>
```
